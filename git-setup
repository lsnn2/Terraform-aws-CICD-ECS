Set up a local git repo for the petclinic application
Start by switching to the petclinic directory:

cd ../petclinic
Set up your git username and email address:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email you@example.com
Now ceate a local git repo for petclinic as follows:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Baseline commit"
Set up the remote CodeCommit repo
An AWS CodeCommit repo was built as part of the pipeline you created. You will now set this up as a remote repo for your local petclinic repo.

For authentication purposes, you can use the AWS IAM git credential helper to generate git credentials based on your IAM role permissions. Run:

git config --global credential.helper '!aws codecommit credential-helper $@'
git config --global credential.UseHttpPath true
From the output of the Terraform build, note the Terraform output source_repo_clone_url_http.

cd ../terraform
export tf_source_repo_clone_url_http=$(terraform output source_repo_clone_url_http)
Set this up as a remote for your git repo as follows:

cd ../petclinic
git remote add origin $tf_source_repo_clone_url_http
git remote -v
You should see something like:

origin  https://git-codecommit.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/petclinic (fetch)
origin  https://git-codecommit.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/petclinic (push)
Trigger the pipeline
To trigger the pipeline, push the master branch to the remote as follows:

git push -u origin master
